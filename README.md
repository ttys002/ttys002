hi there
i'm a macos/linux terminal enthusiast!
current main device: 2020 macbook air m1, running macos 14.2 developer preview (fedora 38 is my secondary OS, running thru UTM VM)
i'm a beginner at this stuff, expect lots of questions on my Ask Different stack exchange profile (https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/508425/average-terminal-user)
